    Aniva Sans is a mutation of Epunda Sans. However, the vertical lines are more strongly emphasized, and organic curves and arches give it a distinctive yet friendly character.

    The font is available as a variable font in eight weights from Thin to ExtraBlack.

    The second axis "opsz" (optical size) leads to a display variant that has the elegance and value of an Antiqua through increased contrast and drop-shaped ends.
